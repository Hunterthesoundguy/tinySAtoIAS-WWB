PowerShell scripts to convert .csv files into a format either IAS or WWB can understand. The scripts were originally based off of [Brad Baisley's TinySAforRFguys](https://github.com/bradbbot/TinySAforRFguys/), but I found the scripts to be rather broken and the documentation poor. So I spent some time to clean them up and make them easier to use :)

##**Written Tutorial:**
Organize the Powershell scripts by placing them in a folder of your choice, where you prefer to store them. Inside this folder, create a new directory and label it "output". Additionally, ensure your .csv file is in the same folder as the Powershell scripts, and name it "input.csv". Now, you're all set to execute the script of your choice. Once the script runs successfully, you'll find its output neatly generated in the "output" folder!

# tinySAtoIAS-WWB
PowerShell scripts to convert csv files into a format either IAS or WWB can understand. The scripts were originally based off of [Brad Baisley's TinySAforRFguys]([url](https://github.com/bradbbot/TinySAforRFguys/)), but i found the scripts to be rather broken. So I spent some time to clean them up and make them easier to use :)
